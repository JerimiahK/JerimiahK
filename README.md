# Jerimiah Kripakov ü•Å

**`Digital Blacksmith üî®`**

My name is Jerimiah Kripakov and I am a full stack developer based in the Denver, CO area. After being a working drummer for almost a decade and being fortunate enough to tour around the country, I have decided to pursue my interest for technology and begin a career as a software developer. I have always been intrigued with how things work down to the most complex and abstract levels so conceiving, constructing, and deploying a highly efficient, refined product is something I have a passion for. I am currently accepting and working on freelance work, mainly front end websites for businesses. My code repo's are always open for viewing to both employers and fellow developers, and if you are interested in hiring me you can email me at jerimiahkripakov@gmail.com.
