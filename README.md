**`Digital Blacksmith`**

My name is Jerimiah Kripakov and I am a full stack developer based in the Denver, CO area. After being a working drummer for almost a decade and being fortunate enough to tour around the country, I have decided to pursue my interest for technology and begin a career as a software developer. I have always been intrigued with how things work down to the most complex and abstract levels so conceiving, constructing, and deploying a highly efficient, refined product is something I have a passion for.
